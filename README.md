# Ciklum-TUI-test

## This is my implementation of the test task for my potential customer (TUI).

### Introduction

Welcome everyone who will review results of my work.

During my implementation of the task I tried to use new approaches for each part.
However, I nevertheless considered some of them too redundant for solving the task and removed them from the current version.

You can add some comments where describe your ideas how to improve the quality of my implementation in the future..

### Description

The service performs a simple function of collecting information about the user's repositories.
This only has one endpoint (/{userName}), which takes the username as a path parameter and returns short 
information about all the repositories of the given user that are not forks, including branch information.
